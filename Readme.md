# Dashboard Lightning Components

This is a list of components to help you create dashboard style apps very quickly using Lightning App Builder. The standard lightning components provided out of the box are quite siloed and don't communicate with each other. The purpose of this code is to create these reusable components which will communicate which each other on the same page. These components are meant to be responsive and touch friendly.

## Current List of Components:

 * **Search List** - Allows you to search on any object. This is a driver component and changes the context of the whole page.
 * **Google Maps** - This component allows you to show google maps and directions for a particular address.
 * **Attachment Upload** - This component allows you to attach files and images from the camera. This also shows a list of attachments to an object
 * **Signature Capture** - This component allows you to capture signatures and upload them.
 * **Simple Charts** - Allows you to create simple charts based on a single group by field
 * **Hierarchy Visualizer** - Allows you to visualize the Account/Contact/Custom Object hierarchy in a visual manner.
 * **Related List Summary** - Allows you to summarize related lists (by counts)
 * **Object Cards** - Allows you to show object details on fields on a page

### Future list of components I would like to build

* Advanced Charts - Bubble charts, Step Charts, Stacked Charts, Line Charts
* Tweets - A list of twitter tweets by the account or contact
* Linked In Profile - The linked in profile of the user
* Nearby - Find a list of contacts and account close to you

This is can be installed via an [unmanaged package](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t240000009fEv). Feel free to contribute to the source code and make this awesome.
